# splat3-seed-tool
A web app with tools to help predict your future (in Splatoon 3).

## Disclaimer
This is mostly just a project for myself to practice react, and to provide an open source look at Splatoon 3's randomization.

Based on [Leanny's project](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/writeup), but written from scratch with my own vision.

## Planned features
- Managing owned gear
- Tracking other sources
- - gacha and shell seeds
- - Murch seeds
- - Title / Banner seeds
